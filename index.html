                <h3>Workshops</h3>
                <p> In recent years, NSD under its Extension Programme organized a series of theatre workshops in the
                    North Eastern States. The workshops proceeded on the basis of a 3-step programme – the first was to
                    arouse interest amongst all participants about the intricacies of the theatre experience –
                    performance and transference; the second was to impart training in the area and the third was to
                    help and guide them to prepare productions on the basis of the received training. The first
                    Poorvottar Natya Samaroh was organized in Guwahati in 2007 and the second at Gangtok, Sikkim in
                    2008.</p>

                <h3>Largest Training Institute</h3>
                <p>Training in the School is unique in several ways. It is based on a thorough, comprehensive and
                    carefully-planned syllabus that covers every aspect of theatre from theory to practice, the results
                    of which are put to test before a wide audience. The syllabus takes into account the methods of
                    great theatre personalities who have shaped contemporary theatre in all its forms and expressions.
                    Training includes broad-based training in classical Indian and western dramatic traditions, Indian
                    traditional and folk theatre, modern theatre trends in India and abroad, introduction of theatre
                    trends of the world, and specialized training in Indian theatre traditions.</p>

                <h3>International Resource Centers</h3>
                <p>With a view to take the theatre movement to the grass root level and to make it more accessible to
                    theatre workers, it was decided to decentralize the Extension Programme and set up Regional Resource
                    Centres in various zones of the country. The first such centre, covering the states of Karnataka,
                    Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Pondicherry, was set up in Bangalore in 1994. The Centre has
                    been very active and has organized quite a large number of workshops in collaboration with State
                    agencies and local theatre groups.</p>
